Guide for Riotkit technologies
==============================

Riotkit is an anarchist technical collective that solves problems by creating a software and by composing from existing blocks.
This guide will show you how we typically work with servers and projects hosted on them.

*Please note that this guide is showing a common way of working with RiotKit's technologies, but actually you can use everything differently,
there is no pressure to do everything in this way, especially outside of RiotKit.*
